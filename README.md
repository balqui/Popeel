Source code for Popeel, a potato-peeling toy software "robot".

Current version 0.1.1.

Should work under both Python2 and Python3.

### What is this repository for? ###

Standard goal: write an algorithm that leads Popeel to peel a
given number of potatoes. Catch: potatoes are peeled one by one,
taken from a basket with a limited number of potatoes. A large
store with infinitely many more potatoes is available, but the
task of going there to refill the basket has to be programmed
explicitly.

Two simpler goals are provided through the "first user" and
"second user" program files.

### How do I get set up? ###

Get the file popeel.py somewhere on your Python path. Files
whose name ends with "user" contain usage examples. Files 
whose name includes "output" contain examples of successful
runs. Program randprog.py writes random usage examples, most
useless - files whose name starts with "rand" have been
generated in that way, feel free to run them.

Of course, the file using Popeel correctly to get successful
output is NOT provided.
